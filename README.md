## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

They also provide variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project but i didn't like the font so i avoid it. I have added Google Fonts links in html file.

They also gave me a `style-guide.md` file containing the information but as i have build the project so iam putting it to `.gitIgnore` file.

## About the project

It was a fun project to do, I chose this project to enriched my knowledge. Through this project i wanted to learn sass so i chose this project to be done by sass. I followed a pattern called 7â€“1 pattern (7 folders, 1 file). And through this project i have learn more about mixin, build-in func, content etc. I have build this project for mobile and desktop, so your will find it broken on tablet as i didn't made it for tablet version.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
